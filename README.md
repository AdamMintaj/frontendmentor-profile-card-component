# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component solution

## Overwiev

This repository holds my solution to the [Profile card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ). Frontend Mentor challenges are frontend exercices where you can test yourself, improve your coding or generally try new things while building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge here was to build a simple, static profile card component according to the designs provided.

## How it went

I completed the challenge using flexbox and some basic css. You can see the outcome [here](https://frontendmentor-profile-card-component-adammintaj.vercel.app/)
